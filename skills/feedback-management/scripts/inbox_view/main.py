"""Read UDF — assemble the human inbox feed (the derived cross-task queue).

Reads ``~/.openfused/app/state.json`` (or the directory named by
``OPENFUSED_APP_DIR_STATE``) directly with stdlib; no third-party imports.

This is the **inbox view**: the inbox is a *derivation*, not a fourth store.
It returns the SAME ``{items, pending}`` shape the Express routes
``GET /api/inbox`` (global) and ``GET /api/projects/:name/inbox`` (drill-in)
returned by hand-assembly, so the UI is unchanged.

The inbox owns **no stored array** — every row is derived/projected. It assembles
five sources from the ONE shared ``state.json`` (F1 — every ``_core`` UDF reads the
same file, so there is no cross-project call):

1. **Card-view questions** — pending wake-bearing cards
   (``continuationPolicy == "wake_assignee"``) whose ``effect`` is NOT
   ``review_work_product`` (i.e. ``reply`` / ``approval_gate``), projected as a
   read-only ``type:"question"`` view carrying ``sourceCardId`` + the full
   ``card`` (the pending-question projection,
   now server-side here). The client resolves these through the card route, not
   the inbox respond route.
2. **Work-product review cards** — pending cards whose
   ``effect == "review_work_product"`` (the ``publish_work_product`` fold),
   projected as ``type:"message"`` Updates rows
   carrying ``sourceCardId`` + the full ``card`` so the UI renders the interactive
   card and resolves it through the card route. Non-blocking
   (``continuationPolicy: "none"``), so they never appear in source 1. An open
   review card suppresses the task's derived completion (source 4) — the review
   IS the report.
3. **``notify`` comments** — ``comments[]`` rows with ``kind == "notify"`` (the
   Phase-4 ``notify_user`` → comment swap), projected as ``type:"message"`` Updates
   rows so the UI's Updates feed is unchanged. The row carries the comment id
   (``cmt_…``), so the inbox respond/dismiss routes recognise it and spawn the
   prose→run reply path; a comment id present in ``dismissedFeedbackKeys`` (appended
   on a human reply/dismiss) excludes an acknowledged one (same mechanism as the
   derived items, source 4/5).
4. **Derived ``completion`` items** — for a task whose LATEST run is terminal
   ``completed`` and whose ``status`` is ``completed`` with no open ``notify``
   comment (a ``notify_user`` IS the completion report). Synthetic
   id ``derived:completion:<runId>``.
5. **Derived ``failure`` items** — for a task whose LATEST run is terminal
   ``failed`` and whose ``status`` is ``failed``. Synthetic id ``derived:failure:<runId>``.

Completion/failure are NO LONGER stored (the run lifecycle stopped minting them);
they are derived here from run + task ``status``. A human DISMISS / RESPOND on a
derived item / notify comment appends its synthetic id (``derived:<type>:<runId>``
or ``cmt_<id>``) to the flat ``dismissedFeedbackKeys`` state field (written by the
respond/dismiss routes via ``acknowledgeFeedbackKey``); this view EXCLUDES any
derived item / notify comment whose id is in that set, so a dismissed item does not
re-appear on the next view (the derived-dismissal
handling). The key is run-scoped, so a re-run mints a new id NOT in the set and the
outcome resurfaces.

Params
------
project : str
    Filter to a single project slug. Empty string (the default) is the GLOBAL
    inbox: items across all projects + global pending-triage tasks.

Returns
-------
dict
    ``{"items": list[dict], "pending": list[dict]}``. ``items`` are inbox rows
    (the InboxItem wire shape the UI consumes), newest-first by ``createdAt``;
    ``pending`` are full task records with ``status == "pending"``.
