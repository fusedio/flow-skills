"""Delete-project UDF — remove every run record (and its transcript) for one project.

Writes ``~/.openfused/app/state.json`` (or the directory named by
``OPENFUSED_APP_DIR_STATE``) directly with stdlib; no third-party imports.

This is the run-management half of the cross-skill **project-delete** cascade:
it deletes the run records belonging to the named project, and removes each
removed run's per-run transcript ``<app_dir>/runs/<runId>.ndjson``. It is the
FIRST destructive write op in run-management — only ``bulk_seed`` wrote before
(``transcript`` stays read-only, ``create``/``finish``/… only mutate single
records). It REUSES ``_transcript_path`` (copied from ``transcript``/``bulk_seed``)
so a traversal-shaped run id can never delete an ``.ndjson`` file outside
``runs/``.

Matching a run for removal
--------------------------
Run records do NOT carry a ``project`` field: ``create`` stamps only ``taskId``,
so a real (live) run has a ``taskId`` but no ``project`` (only ``bulk_seed``-
restored records may carry one). Matching on ``project`` alone would miss every
live run. So a run is removed if EITHER:

- its ``taskId`` is in *task_ids* — the project's deleted task ids, passed by Flow
  from ``task-management.delete_project``'s ``deletedTaskIds`` (the real path), OR
- *project* is non-empty AND ``run.get("project") == project`` — the
  ``bulk_seed``-restored fallback.

Params (all strings)
--------------------
project : str
    The project slug; matches ``bulk_seed``-restored runs that carry a ``project``.
task_ids : str
    A JSON-encoded list of task ids (the project's deleted task ids). A run whose
    ``taskId`` is in this set is removed. ``""``/missing → empty set.

Returns
-------
dict
    A camelCase ack::

        {
            "runsRemoved": N,
            "transcriptsRemoved": N,
        }

Idempotency
-----------
Both *project* and *task_ids* empty → a no-op that returns zero counts and writes
nothing. A removed run whose transcript file is already absent (or whose id
resolves outside ``runs/``) counts as skipped, so a re-run never raises.
